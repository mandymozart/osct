/**
 * GPU feedback buffers for plugins (docs/plugins.md "A feedback buffer"): a fragment shader the engine
 * runs once per frame into a render target of its own, before the scene renders – a fluid, a reaction-diffusion, a
 * painting that remembers. A plugin never gets the renderer: it asks `api.feedback({ width, height, fragment, … })` and
 * gets a handle whose `texture` (and `uniform`, the same as a uniform that follows it) it shows on a material.
 *
 * - **Ping-pong**: a buffer that reads its own previous frame (the channel `"self"`, the default `iChannel0`) has two
 *   targets; every step reads one and writes the other, then they swap. A pass that does not read itself has one target.
 * - **Uniforms** the engine sets before each step: `iTime` (seconds the buffer has run), `iTimeDelta`, `iFrame` (steps
 *   done, 0 on the first), `iResolution` (`vec3(width, height, 1)`), `iChannel0…3` (the channels: `"self"`, another
 *   buffer – its current frame, or a three.js texture). The plugin's own uniforms join them by reference.
 * - **The fragment** is GLSL ES 3.0 (three.js compiles a `ShaderMaterial` as such: `texture`, `int` uniforms) after a prelude that declares those uniforms and `varying vec2 vUv` (0…1 across the
 *   buffer; `vUv * iResolution.xy` is the pixel's centre, as Shadertoy's `fragCoord`); it writes `gl_FragColor`.
 *   `shadertoyFragment` wraps a Shadertoy pass (`mainImage`) into one.
 * - **Precision**: `half` (default) and `float` targets where the device renders into them; otherwise the next lower one
 *   – float → half → 8 bits (`byte`, values clamped to 0…1) – with one warning. `type` on the handle says which it got.
 * - **Pause and ownership**: a buffer created while a node builds (a node type's `build`, a component's `apply`, a
 *   material's `build`) belongs to that node: it steps only while the node's object and every parent are visible in the
 *   scene (a lost target's anchor is hidden, another spread's nodes are gone) and is disposed with the node. One made
 *   elsewhere (in `register`, later in a hook) belongs to the plugin and goes when the plugin is uninstalled. One made in
 *   a post-processing pass's factory (content schema 2.21) belongs to the pass: it steps while the pass runs in a chain
 *   that renders with its passes and goes when the chain drops or rebuilds the pass (`post/chain.ts`). A hidden
 *   page has no frames at all; `paused` on the handle stops one by hand.
 *
 * The view steps every live buffer in creation order (`stepFeedbacks`, from `ArView`'s loop – the reader's and the
 * editor's stage are the same engine), so a pass that reads another buffer created before it sees that buffer's new frame.

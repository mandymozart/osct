/**
 * The built-in `grade`: exposure, contrast, saturation and a tint. The layer is premultiplied: the colour is divided
 * by the alpha before grading and multiplied again after, so an edge keeps its coverage; a texel with alpha 0 (light
 * added by a bloom) is graded as it is. Contrast pivots on linear mid-grey. `reach`: where the image holds the
 * editor's desk or the look-around world too, `ar` keeps the grade off them with the mask (the AR layer's coverage),
 * `all` grades them with it. The phone's camera picture never reaches this buffer (the engine draws it into its own canvas under the
 * three.js canvas): for `all` the engine's camera renderer grades it with the same steps (`cameraGradeShader`).

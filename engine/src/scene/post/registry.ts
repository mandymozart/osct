/**
 * The pass registry: every post-processing type the engine can run – the built-in ones (`./bloom`, `./vignette`,
 * `./grade`, registered by `./index`) and a plugin's own, registered through the plugin API's `registerPass` with
 * the plugin as the owner. The content names passes by type (`passes: [{ type, …params }]`, `shared/types/passes.ts`);
 * `PostChain` builds them from here.
 *
 * A pass is a three.js `Pass` (`render(renderer, writeBuffer, readBuffer)` over the composer's buffers): the read
 * buffer holds the AR layer as the scene rendered it – premultiplied colour over alpha, in linear RGB, nothing of
 * the camera picture, which lies under the canvas (in the editor the stage's desk stands in for it and is part of
 * the buffer: the passes shade it like the camera picture, a grade with `reach: ar` is limited to the AR layer by `setMask`;
 * the look-around world and sky, while drawn, lie in the buffer under the AR layer the same way).
 * A pass that writes alpha 1 everywhere would cover the camera picture with black: a pass keeps the texel's alpha unless it means to shade the camera picture too (a vignette
 * raises the alpha where it darkens – the picture below shows through less).

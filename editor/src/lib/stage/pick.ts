/**
 * The stage's pick filter (three-free), after Blender's select mode: what a click on the stage picks – and what the
 * pointer hovers – by the pick mode, from what lies under the pointer, nearest first. The modes are strict:
 * **entity** picks only an entity (its root, from any of its nodes), **node** only the node under the pointer (as deep
 * as the tree goes), **target** only a printed image. Nothing of the mode's kind under the pointer picks nothing (the
 * workspace then clears the selection). The right click's menu is the one lenient reader: the mode's pick, else the
 * printed image there, so the menu always has what lies under the pointer.

/**
 * Post-processing passes (content schema 2.5): effects over the whole rendered AR image – a bloom, a vignette, a colour
 * grade, a shader of the book's own. A spread names them as `passes: [{ type, ...parameters }]`, run in order on
 * the image the scene rendered, before it lies over the camera picture; the book's `passes` are the default for
 * every spread without a list of its own (an empty list turns them off). Like the components, every built-in type
 * is defined once here – its parameters with kind, default, range and a description – so the editor's rows, the
 * content build, the config guard and the engine read one definition. A plugin's pass (`registerPass`) brings its
 * own spec: since 2.21 a `passes` entry may name it where a declared plugin recorded it (`registered.passes`, schema
 * 2.14) – its parameters checked against that spec like a built-in pass's – and the engine builds it from the plugin's
 * factory in its place in the list; a 2.20 app refuses such a type. Since 2.22 a pass may be switched off
 * (`enabled: false`, #233): it stays in the list with its values, the chain skips it; a 2.21 app ignores the field and
 * so runs the pass.
 *
 * Adding a built-in pass: define it in PASSES, implement it in the engine (`engine/src/scene/post/`), document it in
 * docs/content.md.

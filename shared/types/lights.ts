/**
 * A `light` node (content schema 2.6): a light an author places like any node – under a group or a model it moves
 * with it. Three kinds: a **point** light shines in every direction from the node's origin, a **spot** light in a
 * cone and a **directional** light as parallel rays, both along the node's own −z (turn the node to aim it; the
 * default placement puts a light half a target width above the page, pointing down onto it). Ambient light is the
 * scene's, not a node. Lights cast no shadows.
 *
 * The values live in the node's `light` object; every parameter is defined once here – kind, default, range and a
 * description – so the editor's panel, the content build, the config guard and the engine read one definition
 * (as the filters and the components). A missing value takes the default. Intensity and distance are in the node's
 * units (target widths), whatever the target's printed size: the engine scales them to the world.

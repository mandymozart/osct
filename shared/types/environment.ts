/**
 * The book's environment (content schema 2.8, asset references 2.10): the world around the reader while scanning and
 * the onion sky (`engine/src/scene/look-around`, docs/look-around.md). Book-level only – no per-spread overrides yet.
 * The reader's Graphics switches (Info → Settings) still apply on top: the content says what is drawn, the reader can
 * turn either off. A book without `environment` keeps today's look (`DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT`).
 *
 * The world and the sky can be **assets** (2.10): `worldSrc` names a glTF model (the scenery around the reader, in
 * place of the built-in world's), `skySrc` an equirectangular image (the sky, in place of the built-in world's). Each
 * holds a content path (`/assets/content/…`, the content build writes it from a path below the content folder) or an
 * absolute URL (an uploaded asset of the editor's library). Without them the built-in `world` is drawn whole.

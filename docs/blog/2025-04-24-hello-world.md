# Welcome to Onion Skin Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Onion Skin (OSCT). This documentation site provides comprehensive information about using and extending the OSCT framework.

## Our Key Advantages

OSCT is built on three core principles:

1. **Web AR**: Built directly for browsers using A-Frame and MindAR, making AR experiences accessible without app downloads
2. **Web Components**: Using vanilla custom Web Components for maximum compatibility and performance
3. **Privacy First**: No data tracking whatsoever - all processing happens locally in the browser

## Getting Started

Explore our documentation to learn about:

- State management with the Immer-powered BaseStore
- Working with our custom Web Components
- Creating AR experiences without compromising privacy
- QR code scanning capabilities

We'll be updating this blog with news, tips, and tutorials as the project evolves.
